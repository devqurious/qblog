# The world underneath

This is the closeup of an onion. In fact, so up and close, that you can actually  see the cells and the nucleus within each one of them. The above image is taken at an 800x magnification factor. Although the microscope used here did not have any USB support (high quality microscopes with USB support can be quite expensive!), with a little bit of DIY spirit we were able to take a picture using an iPhone pointed straight down the eye piece.

Here is another shot - this time, as the cells come slowly into focus.

How different, and strange, the world looks underneath! 

And yet, there appear to be similarities whether you go macro, or micro. The basic structure remains the same. There is a centre and there is a world that revolves around it. And it may be that it's the smaller objects that are more fun. The sun is relatively static to it's planets, but the planets are fun. Nucleus is the centre,  but electrons bring magic.
