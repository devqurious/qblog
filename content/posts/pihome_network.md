It's a good idea to visualize where the cloud will sit among other things. We will start with one RPi box as the master. It will be controlled by a Macbook Pro - yes, there are no absolute masters in life. :)

This is the time to also note down the IP addresses of your devices. If you have multiple wired and wireless neteorks make sure you can ping across them. 

Onward!
