AQM tries to emphasize both sides of the brain equally. The humanities is as important as art which is as important of nature. The word "science" is almost banished from the site, although no fault of the word itself. It's just got too much of a bad rep, with folks thinking of science along very narrow lines. In reality, science is just the understanding of nature. 

It happenned in sequence too. First, there was math. Because before you could understand the laws of gravity, you needed to know how to count. Then came physics, and the understanding of the natural world, armed with some math. Finally, there was chemistry - an understanding of the parts of matter armed with the powerful knowlege of electricity from physics. 

Everything is intertwined with each other. It's only when you understand how the twines interweave with each other do you slowly beging to undestand the big picture.

Of our Universe.
