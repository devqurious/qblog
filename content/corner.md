Make space in your home to do the experiments. Any corner is fine. Often times the balconey will offer you that space. If not the balconey, it could be a portion of the garage. Whereever that may be, making space at home is the first step to being curious about things. 

Once you have identified the space, what are the things you need to place in there? 

**A Table**

This is your workbench. Make sure it is as big as you can make it, because you will need the space when you're doing those experiments. A second table for organizing things can be very helpful too. 

**Tools**

You will need some basic tools. Some are more frequently used than the others. You don't need to buy them all at one go - as you complete one experiment and move on to the next, you will slowly build up your collection of tools.

Frequently used

- *Multimeter*, this is indispensable, and you will frequently use it to test the circuit.
- *Wires*, just get an assortment of wires that are handy to get them electrons flowing around. Electrons at rest are boring.
- *Batteries*, they will supply the power to your circuit. You'll need to have battery holders for 1.5V, 3V, 6V, and all the way upto 9V. 
- *LEDs*, mostly to test the circuit again, but there will be other uses. 
- *Wire stripper*, cut and strip wires like a pro. Give a rest to your teeth.
- *Scissors*, cutting stuff.
- *Set of screwdrivers*, screwing stuff.
- *Glue gun*, hot glue to stick stuff together. 
- *Aluminum Tape*, the adhesive kind. To make the connection, and stick things down. How convinient is that! 
- *Breadboard*, and some jumper wires, to test your circuit.
- *Soldering machine*, when you want to make a circuit permanent

The rest of the world

- *Electric Drill*, drilling through metal and wood.   
- *Motorized saw*, for making wood cuts. 

Most the stuff will last for years and years if you maintain them well, so it's well worth the investment into your child's future learning.
